    <summary>Cassiopeia</summary>
    <p>
      Cassiopeia is a large constellation located in the northern sky. It was
      named after Cassiopeia, the vain and boastful queen in Greek mythology.
      Nicknamed the W constellation, Cassiopeia is easily recognizable for the
      prominent W asterism formed by its five brightest stars. The constellation
      was first catalogued by the Greek astronomer Ptolemy in the 2nd century,
      along with other constellations in the Perseus family (except Lacerta).
      Cassiopeia contains several notable deep sky objects, among them the open
      clusters Messier 52 and Messier 103, the Heart Nebula and the Soul Nebula,
      the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A, the star-forming cloud popularly known
      as the Pacman Nebula, and the White Rose Cluster.

    <summary>Little Dipper</summary>
  <p>
    The Little Dipper is an asterism formed by seven bright stars in the
    constellation Ursa Minor, the Little Bear. It is smaller and fainter than
    its larger counterpart, the Big Dipper. The asterism has historically
    played an important role in navigation because it includes Polaris, the
    North Star. The seven stars that form the Little Dipper are: Polaris
    (Alpha Ursae Minoris), Kochab (Beta Ursae Minoris), Yildun (Delta Ursae
    Minoris), Pherkad (Gamma Ursae Minoris), Zeta Ursae Minoris, Eta Ursae
    Minoris, and Epsilon Ursae Minoris. The brightest of these, Polaris, is
    the 48th brightest star in the sky. It is the nearest bright star to the
    north celestial pole. The faintest, Eta Ursae Minoris, shines at magnitude
    4.95 and is challenging to see from light-polluted areas. Polaris is very
    useful in navigation because not only does its location mark true north,
    but its angle above the horizon helps find the observer’s latitude on
    Earth. Observers standing on the North Pole see the North Pole star
    directly overhead. For those in the mid-northern latitudes, the star
    appears halfway between the zenith and the horizon. Observers near the
    equator can theoretically see the North Star very close to the horizon if
    the geography allows it.

    <summary>Big Dipper</summary>
  <p>
    The Big Dipper is an asterism formed by seven bright stars in the
    constellation Ursa Major, the Great Bear. It is one of the most
    recognizable star patterns in the night sky. The asterism is well-known in
    many cultures and goes by many other names, including the Plough, the
    Great Wagon, Saptarishi, and the Saucepan. The seven stars that form the
    Big Dipper are: Alkaid (Eta Ursae Majoris), Mizar (Zeta Ursae Majoris),
    Alioth (Epsilon Ursae Majoris), Megrez (Delta Ursae Majoris), Phecda
    (Gamma Ursae Majoris), Dubhe (Alpha Ursae Majoris), and Merak (Beta Ursae
    Majoris). In northern latitudes, the Big Dipper is visible throughout the
    year. It is one of the first star patterns we learn to identify, along
    with Orion’s Belt, Cassiopeia’s W, and the Northern Cross in Cygnus.

<summary>Cygnus</summary>
<p>
  Cygnus constellation is associated with several myths, most frequently the
  one of the Spartan Queen Leda, who gave birth to two sets of twins, the
  immortal Pollux and Helen and mortal Castor and Clytemnestra, after being
  seduced by the god Zeus, who had transformed himself into a swan. The
  immortal children were fathered by the god and the mortal ones by Leda’s
  husband, King Tyndareus. Castor and Pollux are represented by the zodiac
  constellation Gemini. Cygnus is also sometimes identified as Orpheus, the
  Greek tragic hero who met his end at the hands of the Thracian Maenads for
  not honouring Dionysus. After his passing, Orpheus was transformed into a
  swan and placed next to his lyre in the sky. The lyre is represented by
  the neighbouring constellation Lyra. Cygnus constellation is also
  sometimes associated with any of the several people called Cycnus in Greek
  mythology. The most famous ones are Cycnus, the son of Ares who met his
  end after challenging Hercules to a duel, Cycnus, the son of Poseidon, who
  fought on the side of the Trojans in the Trojan War, met his end at the
  hands of Achilles and was transformed into a swan, and Cycnus, a close
  friend of Phaeton, the mortal son of the Sun god Helios. Of the above
  three, the myth of Phaeton is the one that is most frequently associated
  with Cygnus constellation.
